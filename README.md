# IAB207 - Assessment Task 3

@Rowan:

- On the Index page, match the names of the categories on the left side (the buttons under 'Choose Category') with the names of the Navbar. They must be the same and in the same order.
- Follow the index counting like I did with the navbar for linking and referencing their ID to the browse_all.html page
- Create a few listings under different categories and then test
